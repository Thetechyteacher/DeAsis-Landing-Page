<h2> How It's Made: </h2>

This project involved a close collaboration with a UI designer. The customer's views were really important and always taken into account when it came to the design and user experience of the webpage. 
The result was 100% what the customer required. 

Tech used: <b> HTML, CSS and JavaScript. </b>

<h2> Optimizations: </h2>

This project could be optimized by adding some React components and a "Contact Me" form.

<h2> Lessons Learned: </h2>

UX and UI design were an important part of this project. Wanting to use the brand color theme and what the customer wanted to portray to prospective clients. 

<h2> Examples: </h2>

Take a look at these examples that I have in my own portfolio:
